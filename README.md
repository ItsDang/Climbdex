# Climbdex

Climbdex is a search engine for ["standardized interactive climbing training boards" (SICTBs)](https://gearjunkie.com/climbing/kilter-moon-grasshopper-more-interactive-climbing-training-boards-explained) designed with the goal of adding missing functionality to boards that utilize [Aurora Climbing's](https://auroraclimbing.com/) software, such as [Kilter](https://settercloset.com/pages/the-kilter-board), 
[Tension](https://tensionclimbing.com/product/tension-board-sets/), and [Decoy](https://decoy-holds.com/pages/decoy-board). The primary missing feature provided by this engine is a "filter by hold" feature to find climbs with specific sets of holds. There are some additional improvements to other options for filtering and sorting through climbs as well.

Try it out [here](https://climbdex.fly.dev/). Currently, all sizes of the Kilter Original layout are supported. The goal is to extend this project to cover all layouts and boards that run the Aurora Climbing software.

This app was partially inspired by Tim Parkin's excellent [Moonboard Search Engine](http://mb.timparkin.net/).

The databases are downloaded and synchronized using [BoardLib](https://github.com/lemeryfertitta/BoardLib).
